# Voting

In various situations the CDF TOC shall hold a vote. These votes can happen on the phone, email, or via a voting service, when appropriate. TOC members can either respond "agree, yes, +1", "disagree, no, -1", or "abstain". A vote passes depending on the requirements placed on the activity in the charter. An abstain vote equals not voting at all.
