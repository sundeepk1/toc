# CDF Special Interest Groups ("SIGs")

The CDF TOC Special Interest Groups scale contributions by the CDF technical and user community,
while retaining integrity and increasing quality in support of our mission.

TOC and TOC Contributors have fulfilled SIG duties in the past and will continue to do so until a specific SIG takes on that responsibility.
